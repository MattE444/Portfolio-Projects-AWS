# Deploy a Multi-Tier Web App using AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## Introduction
The app I'm using I had created by chatGPT in Python.  Its an app to track all of of my job applications.  I'm pushing this project to the front of the line simply because I want to have the job tracker app in place to actually start tracking my applications.  I'll still do the other projects but after I do this one and the next one first.

## AWS Services used
- DynamoDB
- Elastic Beanstalk

## Steps to complete:
1. Create the DynamoDB Table 
   - Bucket MUST have the same name as the domain name.
